# Polaroid it!
A simple tool that turns any image into a polaroid. It uses filename to create an anotation.

## How do I use it?
Easy: Just go to [https://codingcarlos.github.io/polaroid-it](https://codingcarlos.github.io/polaroid-it), and select a picture.

Don´t worry, your picture won´t be uploaded anywhere. Everything happens in your browser.

## Are you a web dev?

### How do I run it?
It's just a static page. No fancy frameworks. No server. No bullshit. Just clone the repo, and open the index in your browser. Easy peasy. 

### Why
I was a little bit nostagic, and I wanted to do a double nostagia project: Old school pictures with old school dev techniques. I love modern web dev tools, don't get me wrong. But sometimes I feel it is too much magic at the time. Bundlers, fake imports, transpilators, frameworks... This is how the internet was 10 years ago. Or maybe 15. It's ok.

This is not meant to become a huge project. Nor to have people contributing.

This is just a quick friday project to have some fun, and do something out of my confort zone.

### Contributing
What the hell? Are you serious? Ok, if you are, feel free to submit a PR. Why not? It's free! But let's keep the original spirit up: No tools, no bundlers, no servers. Just static stuff. Happy hacking!
